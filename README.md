## üìê Project Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern to ensure a clear
separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

* **Model**: Represents the data layer, including data sources (local database) and repositories.
* **View**: Comprises the UI components (Fragments, Activities) that observe changes from the
  ViewModel.
* **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, exposing data streams and handling
  UI-related logic.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

* **Android Studio**: Dolphin | 2021.3.1 or higher
* **JDK**: Version 11 or higher
* **Android SDK**: Minimum API Level 25 (Android 7.1 Nougat)
* **Local Database**: Data will be managed through Room Persistence Library.
